> **I have put a lot of effort into the [documentation](https://zaney.org/zaneyos-2.2/) so it should be accurate. However, please if you notice that something is wrong with it create an issue or reach out to me on Discord.**

#### üçñ Requirements
- You must be running on NixOS.
- The zaneyos folder (this repo) is expected to be in your home directory.
- Must have installed using GPT & UEFI. Systemd-boot is what is supported, for GRUB you will have to brave the internet for a how-to. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
- Manually editing your host specific files. The host is the specific computer your installing on.

#### üéπ Pipewire, Spotify, & Notification Menu Controls
- We are using the latest and greatest audio solution for Linux. If you like listening to music Spotify comes pre-installed out of the box. Not to mention you will have media and volume controls in the notification center available in the top bar.

#### üèá Optimized Workflow, tmpfs For Speed, & Simple Yet Elegant Neovim
- Using scratchpads with Hyprland for increased functionality and effeciency.
- A tmpfs for the /tmp directory is created improving rebuild time and reducing strain on hdd/ssd.
- No massive Neovim project here. This is my simple, easy to understand, yet incredible Neovim setup. You can grep recursively through entire folders and find specific files without ever leaving the text editor!

#### üñ•Ô∏è Multi Host & User Configuration
- You can now define separate settings for different host machines and users!
- Easily specify extra packages for your users in the users.nix file.
- Easy to understand file structure and simple, but encompassing, configuratiion.

#### üëº An Incredible Community Focused On Support
- The entire idea of ZaneyOS is to make NixOS an approachable space that is actually a great community that you want to be in.
- Many people who are patient and happy to spend their free time helping you are running ZaneyOS. Feel free to reach out on the Discord for any help with anything.

#### üì¶ How To Install Packages?
- You can search the [Nix Packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages?) & [Options](https://search.nixos.org/options?) pages for what a package may be named or if it has options available that take care of configuration hurdles you may face.
- To add a package there are the sections for it in config.nix and users.nix in your host folder. One is for programs available system wide and the other for your users environment only.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Install

#### üìú Script:

This is the easiest and recommended way of starting out. The script is not meant to allow you to change every option that you can in the flake or help you install extra packages. It is simply here so you can get my configuration installed with as little chances of breakages and then fiddle to your hearts content!

Simply copy this and run it:

```
nix-shell -p git curl
```

Then this:

```
sh <(curl -L https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos/-/raw/main/install-zaneyos.sh)
```

Now when this is done you will need to reboot.

#### ü¶Ω Manual:

Run this command to ensure Git & Vim are installed:

```
nix-shell -p git vim
```

Clone this repo & enter it:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/zaney/zaneyos.git
cd zaneyos
```

- *You should stay in this folder for the rest of the install*

Create the host folder for your machine(s)

```
cp -r hosts/default hosts/<your-desired-hostname>
```

**ü™ßü™ßü™ß Edit options.nix ü™ßü™ßü™ß**

Generate your hardware.nix like so:

```
nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/hardware.nix
```

Run this to enable flakes and install the flake replacing hostname with whatever you put as the hostname:

```
NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes" 
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname
```

Now when you want to rebuild the configuration you have access to an alias called flake-rebuild that will rebuild the flake!

Hope you enjoy!
